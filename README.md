###### Why 

The original pekeUpload was great, but i needed some changes and the support was slow. So i forked a new project to do my custom work on it.

###### Use
1.  Download solriaUpload zip.
2.  Unzip solriaUpload zip.
3.  Then add a reference to the jQuery library.
    ```
    <script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery-2.1.4.min.js"></script>
    ```
    
4.  Below the reference to jQuery, add a reference to the pekeUpload script.
    ```
    <script type="text/javascript" src="js/solriaUpload.min.js"></script>
    ```
    
5.  On the page, add a file input.
    ```
    <input id="file" type="file" name="file" />
    ```
    
6.  Initialize solriaUpload on the file input.
    ```
    $("#file").solriaUpload();
    ```

###### Sever side script considerations

The file is received by the server side script with the name of the input, for example: if you set that the name of the input is image, then you must expect on the server-side script an input called image.

The server side script must return '1' or '{success:1}', if you wish to attach more data to the response just print a json string, if you want to set your custom error message, return the error property on the json string. See upload.php
